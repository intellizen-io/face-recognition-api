# Face Recognition API

This is a face recognition API developed by Intellizen, a software company that specializes in AI and machine learning solutions. The API is designed to recognize faces in images and videos using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms.

The API provides a RESTful interface for developers to integrate face recognition capabilities into their applications. It can be used for a variety of applications, such as identity verification, surveillance, and access control.

## Features

The Face Recognition API includes the following features:

* Face detection: The API can detect faces in images and videos using the Haar cascades algorithm.
* Face recognition: The API can recognize faces in images and videos using deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks.
* Face identification: The API can identify a specific person in a set of images or videos based on a reference image.
* Face clustering: The API can group similar faces together based on their visual features.
* Image and video processing: The API can process images and videos in a variety of formats, including JPEG, PNG, and MP4.

## Usage

To use the Face Recognition API, you will need to sign up for an API key on the Intellizen website. Once you have an API key, you can use the API to recognize faces in images and videos by sending HTTP requests to the API endpoint.

The API supports a variety of parameters that allow you to customize the face recognition process, such as the detection threshold, the recognition model, and the clustering threshold.

## Technologies

The Face Recognition API is built using the following technologies:

* Python: The API server is implemented in Python, a high-level programming language that is commonly used for AI and machine learning applications.
* Flask: The API server is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python that provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications.
* OpenCV: The API uses OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, for face detection and image processing.
* TensorFlow: The API uses TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, for deep learning-based face recognition.
